\section{Post-Secondary and Career Goals}
My primary career goal is to pursue a position as a Cybersecurity Architect or Artificial Intelligence Engineer. I plan to deepen my knowledge in both fields through targeted coursework and hands-on projects, focusing on network security, threat analysis, and machine learning. By gaining practical experience through internships, I aim to develop innovative solutions that protect sensitive data while ensuring compliance with industry standards. I envision integrating AI with cybersecurity to enhance system resilience against evolving threats. Ultimately, I aspire to lead advancements that contribute to a safer digital landscape.
